              Fig Films is named after a cat. Both Jessi and Holly are obsessed with cats; especially their own rescue cats Fig (Holly’s) and Wesley (Jessi’s). Wesley Films didn’t quite flow so Fig became the leading contender. But once we started looking into figs, it transpired that the name was even more apt for this production company than we had first realised. The fig fruit has a remarkable and symbolic history. The word  ‘fig’ (sykon) derives from the Greek word ‘vulva’. In Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar, the fig tree becomes iconic for the protagonist Esther’s inner turmoil, as a young woman torn between the different wishes and desires she feels and society tells her to feel.

            <p class="lh-lg about-text">
              In a serendipitous way, the fig became a symbol for us and the kind of films we want to make. We want to represent and join others in a new wave of feminine filmmaking which is intersectional; where power, ego and hierarchy are replaced with respect, humility and equality. Rather than pander to patronising claims of ‘giving voice to the voiceless’, we want to collaborate in partnership with historically marginalised people and grow Fig Films to be representative of those communities.  We’ve created a manifesto which explains our ethos and goals further - that you can read <a class="link-dark" href="manifesto.html">here</a>
