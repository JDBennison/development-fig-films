                Fig Films is named after a cat. Both Jessi and Holly are obsessed with cats; especially their own rescue cats Fig (Holly’s) and Wesley (Jessi’s). Wesley Films didn’t quite flow so Fig became the leading contender. But once we started looking into figs, it transpired that the name was even more apt for this production company than we had first realised. The fig fruit has a remarkable and symbolic history. The word  ‘fig’ (sykon) derives from the Greek word ‘vulva’. In Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar, the fig tree becomes iconic for the protagonist Esther’s inner turmoil, as a young woman torn between the different wishes and desires she feels and society tells her to feel.

              <p class="lh-lg about-text">
                In a serendipitous way, the fig became a symbol for us and the kind of films we want to make. We want to represent and join others in a new wave of feminine filmmaking which is intersectional; where power, ego and hierarchy are replaced with respect, humility and equality. Rather than pander to patronising claims of ‘giving voice to the voiceless’, we want to collaborate in partnership with historically marginalised people and grow Fig Films to be representative of those communities.  We’ve created a manifesto which explains our ethos and goals further - that you can read <a class="link-light" href="manifesto.html">here.</a>

            <p class="lh-lg about-text">Jessi moved into the charity filmmaking sphere, after being disenchanted with what felt like making films simply to make big companies money. She realised that impact is what drives her, rather than filmmaking for filmmaking’s sake. Now formally trained in content production during humanitarian emergencies, through a prestigious International Federation of the Red Cross programme, she has gained much experience of global complex shoots and informed consent. A documentary director at heart who has recently discovered a love/hate relationship with producing narrative. She is particularly passionate about the hybrid documentary form and making films about the climate crisis that aren’t issue-based.</p>

              Holly's love for filmmaking and storytelling began in her primary school years when she first picked up the tape camcorder her parents had managed to borrow back in the 1990s. Fast forward to the present, and not all that much has changed - although after a lifelong obsession with the hyper-documentation of her friends and family (and cat) using whatever cameras she could get hold of, she decided to turn her attention to the wider issues that affect the world around us. Since completing her Masters in Ethnographic and Documentary Filmmaking at University College London in 2017 (with distinction), she has focused on themes such as loneliness, cultural heritage, and trafficking in her documentary filmmaking and charity work; often exploring larger, philosophical concepts through the eyes of individual/s and, where possible, finding lightness, humour and hope in the dark. Since working as an in-house Producer Director for the British Red Cross, she has also become very passionate about co-production as the future (and indeed present) of filmmaking.
